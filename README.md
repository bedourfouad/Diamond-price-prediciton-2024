# Diamond Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to build predictive models to estimate the prices of diamonds based on various attributes, such as carat weight, dimensions, and other relevant features. The project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide insights into diamond pricing.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with features and target price.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data for predicting diamond prices.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- `carat`: Weight of the diamond.
- `x`: Length of the diamond in mm.
- `y`: Width of the diamond in mm.
- `z`: Depth of the diamond in mm.
- `depth`: The depth percentage of the diamond.
- `table`: The width of the diamond’s top relative to the widest point.
- `price`: Price of the diamond (target variable).

## Installation
To set up the environment for this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Data**: Load the training and test datasets using Pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
   - Handle missing or zero values.
   - Scale the features using Min-Max scaling.
3. **Split the Data**: Divide the training data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Implement and train various regression models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regression
   - Random Forest Regression
5. **Prediction**: Predict diamond prices using the trained models on the test dataset.
6. **Export Predictions**: Save the predicted prices to a CSV file.

## Modeling Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Used for basic price prediction based on linear relationships.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Provides a non-linear approach to price prediction.
- **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²)
- Adjusted R-squared

## Conclusion
This project successfully implements various regression techniques to predict diamond prices. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can gain insights into the factors that influence diamond pricing, leading to more informed buying and selling decisions.
